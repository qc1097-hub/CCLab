      In this project, we're required to apply Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Dynamic Array, iterations (for-loop)
      and other functions to create a "particle World" and also add more motions to it. After watching the class slide,
      I suddenly wanted to create a lot of petals and make it flow with wind like "petal rain". However, when I actually
      started to do this, I thought if I just draw petals that might be too simple and maybe not that interesting, so I
      finally decided to draw a whole flower as a "particle". After drawing flowers, I add some leaves as well as
      changing the background color to make it more spring-like. Some challenges I faced while designing this project
      are designing properties, making flowers spinning around and adjusting names to design motions for leaves. Sakura
      and leaves will appear on screen, flowing with the wind.
      And players can interact with it by clicking the mouse, it will make some sakura appear.
