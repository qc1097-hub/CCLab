                <p>Marlene, Discovered in th deep ocean</p>

                <h3 class="green">Family:</h3>
                <p>Wavy Pearls are social creatures that live in groups. Each family often gathers in a curved line, resembling a string of pearls gently swaying under the sea. Every Wavy Pearl has its own unique size and personality and they can change their colors according to their surroundings.
They are creatures yet also magical stones, which allows them to communicate with rocks and other natural elements. Wavy Pearls are lively and love to play with rocks, but the rocks are quiet and reserved. Sometimes, when the rocks will just “run away.”

                <h3 class="green">Habitat:</h3>
                <p>Wavy Pearls love to eat seaweed and are very sensitive to temperature.
When the water gets warm, their colors turn brighter and warmer; when it gets cold, their colors become cooler and softer. When they feel happy, they spin joyfully in circles. And they always try to play with the rocks, because they are always so energetic and never need to sleep!

                <li>Wavy Pearls are social marine creatures that live in harmonious groups deep beneath the ocean surface. They often gather in gentle curves, resembling a string of pearls swaying with the currents. Each Wavy Pearl differs in size and personality, giving every cluster its own unique character. They are creatures as well as magical stones so they can communicate with rocks and other natural elements. They are very sensitive to temperature, when the water gets warm, their colors turn brighter and warmer and if it gets cold, their colors become cooler and softer. Wavy Pearls love to eat seaweed and are always full of energy, never needing sleep. When they feel happy, they spin joyfully in circles. They often try to make friends with rocks, though the quiet rocks sometimes prefer to stay alone. Graceful, vibrant, and endlessly energetic, Wavy Pearls bring color and energy to the deep-sea world, dancing with the waves in their underwater home.
